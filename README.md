Week 2 Day 2
Learning Activity: Using Functions Practice


1. Create a programpoem.py that asks the user for 2 parts of speech as input (a plural noun and an adjective) and outputs the following:

______ are red, violets are blue Monty Python is _______, woo hoo!

Make sure to convert the strings to the proper case so that the first blank is capitalized and the second blank is all lower case.

An example run of this program might be:
> Please enter a plural noun: LEGOS 
> Please enter an adjective: AWESOME 
> Legos are red, violets are blue
> Monty Python is awesome, woo hoo!

2. Write a program madfun.py that takes a decimal number as inputfrom the user and prints out the following:
    a. The absolute value of the number
    b. The number rounded to 0 decimal places
    c. The square root of the rounded number’s absolute value

    Example runs of this program might be:
    > Please enter a number: 8.88
    > 8.88
    > 9.0
    > 3.0

    > Please enter a number: -24.75
    > 24.75
    > -25.0
    > 5.0

3. Don’t forget to use meaningful variable names and add comments, and test.
